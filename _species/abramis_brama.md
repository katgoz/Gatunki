The common bream (*Abramis brama*) is a species of freshwater fish native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is known for its deep, laterally compressed body and widespread presence in rivers, lakes, and ponds.

### Key Characteristics

* **Appearance:**
    * Deep, laterally compressed body with silver scales.
    * Large, slightly blunt head.
    * Long dorsal fin and forked tail.
    * Can grow up to 80 cm in length and weigh up to 6 kg.
* **Reproduction:**
    * Spawns in shallow areas during spring, typically in May or June.
    * Eggs are laid on aquatic vegetation, and the young hatch after 2–3 weeks.
    * Males reach sexual maturity at 3–4 years, while females mature at 4–5 years.
* **Habitat:**
    * Found in freshwater lakes, rivers, and reservoirs throughout Europe and parts of Asia.
    * Prefers slow-moving waters with dense vegetation.
* **Diet:**
    * Omnivorous: Feeds on a wide range of plant material, invertebrates, and detritus.
    * Young bream feed on plankton, while adults consume larger plant material and benthic organisms.
* **Behavior:**
    * Typically lives in schools, especially in larger bodies of water.
    * Known for being a bottom feeder, scavenging along the substrate for food.

### Unique Adaptations

* **Adaptability to Environment:** The bream can thrive in a variety of aquatic environments, from slow-moving rivers to lakes with abundant plant life.
* **Schooling Behavior:** Bream often form large schools for protection against predators, allowing them to move efficiently and reduce individual risk.
* **Feeding Strategy:** Their wide mouths and robust jaws allow them to feed on a variety of plant material and detritus from the lakebed, making them versatile feeders.

### Conservation Status and Threats

* **Least Concern:** The common bream is classified as "Least Concern" by the IUCN due to its wide distribution and large population.
* **Threats:**
    * Pollution of water bodies, particularly from agricultural runoff and industrial waste.
    * Overfishing, especially in regions where bream is a popular target for recreational fishing.
    * Habitat degradation due to damming of rivers and drainage of wetlands.
    * Climate change, which may alter water temperatures and affect spawning patterns.

### Interesting Facts

* Bream are known for their ability to grow quickly and can reach sizable sizes in just a few years under optimal conditions.
* They are often targeted in sport fishing due to their size and abundance in many European freshwater bodies.
* While primarily a bottom feeder, bream may also forage near the surface during certain times of the year, particularly in areas with abundant food.
* The species' wide tolerance for varying water conditions makes it one of the most adaptable fish species in Europe.

### Conservation Efforts

* Efforts to reduce pollution in freshwater habitats and improve water quality.
* Sustainable fishing practices, including size and bag limits for recreational fishermen.
* Habitat restoration projects, especially in areas impacted by human development.
* Monitoring of populations to track changes in distribution and health due to environmental pressures.
